### Demo Scenario: WKND Fly (T&H) -- WILL BE PRESENTED BY ADOBE PARTNER SOLUTION CONSULTANT

Challenge:

WKND Fly wants to learn more about their customers, their online and offline behaviour. They are adding AEP and Data Collection tag to their website and mobile app to gather information about what the users are looking at on the web page and mobile app, observe the purchase funnel and use this information to deliver more relevant and personalised experience.

## BREAKOUTS

During the Breakouts each team works on one scenario from the list below:

### Scenario A: Luma One (Retail)

Challenge:

Cart abandonment is one of the biggest challenges digital retailers like Luma One are facing today. Some people got distracted, some of them just found cheaper products. It is important to have a good marketing strategy and relevant messaging to keep customers engaged and try to make them come back and finish the purchase. Cart Abandonment Email is a good pattern for this strategy.

### Scenario C: SecurFinance One (FSI)

Challenge:

Secure Finance One is a financial services institution (FSI) that offers a wide range of products and services such as banking, investments, insurance, and loans. To stay competitive in the rapidly evolving digital landscape, Secure Finance One aims to provide seamless and personalized customer experiences across multiple touchpoints. Their main objective is to create personalized and contextualized customer journeys that can be delivered through mobile (push and in-app) and email.

Their main Business goal is to grow revenue for engaged Customers through upsell/cross-sell. Currently the biggest challenges are the siloed technology which impacts the Real-time knowledge of the Customers and the lack of intelligent Personalization. Secure Finance One is expecting you as a partner to propose a solution to help their Customers having an unique experience. 

#### Tips/Ideas for the Scenario 1 

* A potential Customer is looking for opening an account with a bank and is browsing saving banking solutions to take advantage of the current higher interest rates.  
* An article about Secure Finance One gives great references about the financial products offered. Customer decides to go to their website and starts looking for saving accounts and other saving options.
* Meanwhile decides to create an account with the Bank registering on the website. A personalized email confirmation is sent to the Customer containing some savings offers/content with a link to the respective savings form.
* Customer fills the form (or is pre-filled) and submits the request receiving a mobile push confirmation or email depending on the channel preference.

Their main Business goals are to grow revenue for engaged Customers through upsell/cross-sell, and Deepen Customer relationships and loyalty. 
Currently the biggest challenges are the siloed technology which impacts the Real-time knowledge of the Customers and can't leverage AI/ML automated decisioning to drive more effective Marketing engagement. Secure Finance Two is expecting you as a partner to propose a solution to help their Customers having a unique experience. 

#### Tips/Ideas for the Scenario 2 

* Customer is looking for a house on House Find website. This action puts her/him in the "Looking for a house" segment and Secure Financial Two uses this information to personalize the home page for her making the Home Loan page accessible with one click. 
* Customer navigates to the Secure Financial Two Home Loan page which contains a mortgage calculator. Here, she/he can easily calculate the monthly payment and decides to apply. 
* The form is already pre-populated with Customer's data which simplifies the process. She/he fills out the form uploading necessary documents and submits her/his application on receiving a confirmation email. 
* The Customer likes the property she/he found so much that she/he decides to make an offer. Using the Secure Financial Two mobile app, Customer sends her/his preapproval document to the realtor receiving an email confirmation. 
* Sometime later, Customer receives another message confirming that her/his closing documents were accepted.
